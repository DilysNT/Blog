  <h2>Introduction to the Literature</h2>
  <p>The procedure identified in clinical practice as the baby root canal (pulpotomy) has been the subject of extensive systematic review and meta-analysis. The academic discourse centers primarily on the selection of medicaments and their comparative success rates in maintaining pulp vitality and clinical function. Historically, Formocresol was the ubiquitous agent; however, concerns regarding its toxicity have driven research toward alternative modalities such as Ferric Sulfate, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA), and Laser therapy. This article synthesizes current peer-reviewed data to evaluate the evidence supporting these variations of vital pulp therapy in primary molars.</p>

  <h2>Formocresol: The Historical Baseline</h2>
  <p>For decades, Formocresol was the benchmark against which all other agents were measured.</p>

  <h3>Efficacy vs. Toxicity</h3>
  <p>Longitudinal studies indicate that Formocresol pulpotomies achieve clinical success rates ranging from 70% to 90%. However, the mechanism—chemical fixation—raises concerns. Research has highlighted the potential for systemic distribution of formaldehyde and potential mutagenic effects. A meta-analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration has consistently flagged these safety concerns, driving the shift in the standard of care for the baby root canal toward biologically inductive rather than destructive agents.</p>

  <h2>Ferric Sulfate: Hemostasis without Fixation</h2>
  <p>Ferric Sulfate emerged as a popular alternative due to its mechanism of agglutination.</p>

  <h3>Clinical Outcomes</h3>
  <p>Studies comparing Ferric Sulfate to Formocresol reveal statistically similar clinical outcomes in terms of symptom resolution and tooth retention. Ferric Sulfate works by forming a ferric ion-protein complex that mechanically seals blood vessels, achieving hemostasis without deep tissue fixation. However, radiographic reviews indicate a slightly higher incidence of internal resorption in Ferric Sulfate cases. Despite this, the absence of systemic toxicity makes it a favorable evidence-based choice for the baby root canal in many clinical guidelines.</p>

  <h2>Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA): The Biologic Gold Standard</h2>
  <p>The most robust data in recent literature supports the use of MTA.</p>

  <div class="clinical-box">
    <h3>🔬 Histological Superiority</h3>
    <p>MTA is a bioactive calcium silicate cement. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) consistently show that MTA pulpotomies have higher clinical and radiographic success rates than both Formocresol and Ferric Sulfate, often exceeding 95%. Histologically, MTA induces the formation of a dentin bridge, preserving the vitality of the radicular pulp and maintaining the normal health of the periradicular tissues. The literature suggests that for the modern baby root canal, MTA or similar bioceramics represent the highest standard of efficacy, despite the higher material cost.</p>

  <h2>The Impact of the Final Restoration</h2>
  <p>Research also isolates the restorative variable.</p>

  <h3>Crown vs. Filling</h3>
  <p>A systematic review of survival rates indicates that the type of final restoration is a more significant predictor of success than the pulpotomy medicament itself. Teeth restored with Stainless Steel Crowns (SSC) show significantly lower failure rates compared to those restored with amalgam or composite resins. The hermetic seal provided by the SSC prevents bacterial microleakage, which the literature identifies as the primary cause of late-stage failure in baby root canal therapy.</p>

  <p>The synthesis of current evidence suggests a transition in the best practices for the <a href="https://dilysnt.github.io/Blog/baby-root-canal.html" style="color: var(--primary);">baby root canal</a>. While Formocresol and Ferric Sulfate remain clinically viable, the literature heavily favors MTA/bioceramics for their biocompatibility and high success rates. Furthermore, the data underscores that the procedure must be coupled with a full-coverage stainless steel crown to maximize the probability of long-term survival until exfoliation.</p>
