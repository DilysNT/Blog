  <h2>Introduction to the "Shark Tooth" Fear</h2>
  <p>Every day in my practice, patients come in for cosmetic consults, and they all have the same picture on their phone. It’s usually a horror story from TikTok showing someone with tiny little pegs filed down to nubs. They look at me with wide eyes and ask, "Doc, do you need to shave teeth for veneers like that?" I spend a lot of time de-escalating this fear. The reality of modern veneers is miles away from those viral videos. Let's break down what actually happens in the chair, why we touch the teeth at all, and why the "no-prep" promise isn't always the dream solution it sounds like.</p>

  <h2>The "Chiclet" Effect: Why We Prep</h2>
  <p>When patients ask about shaving teeth, I usually hand them a mirror. I ask them to imagine gluing a fake fingernail on top of their existing fingernail. What happens? It gets thick. It gets bulky.</p>

  <div class="warning-box">
    <h3>🚫 Avoiding the Horse-Tooth Look</h3>
    <p>If I don't remove a tiny layer of your enamel—about the thickness of a contact lens—and I just glue porcelain on top, your teeth are going to look huge. They will feel thick to your tongue, and your lips might not even close over them naturally. We call this the "Chiclet" look or "horse teeth." To give you a smile that looks natural, delicate, and refined, I have to make room for the porcelain. By removing a microscopic layer, I can slide the veneer in so it sits flat and flush with your gums, looking like it grew there.</p>

  <h2>The "No-Prep" Myth vs. Reality</h2>
  <p>There is a lot of marketing out there promising "zero-prep" veneers. But is it true?</p>

  <h3>When No-Prep Actually Works</h3>
  <p>In very specific cases, the answer is actually no. This works if you have small teeth with gaps between them (diastemas) or teeth that are slanted inward. In these cases, we <em>want</em> to add bulk to close the gaps and fill out the smile. But for 90% of the people I see, their teeth are already normal size. Adding to them without prepping creates a disaster. I have had to cut off many "no-prep" veneers done elsewhere because the patient couldn't floss, their gums were bleeding, and they hated how bulky they felt.</p>

  <h2>What Does the Prep Actually Feel Like?</h2>
  <p>The fear isn't just about the look; it's about the feeling.</p>

  <p><strong>It’s Not a Crown:</strong> Those scary pictures of "stubs" you see online? Those are usually for full dental crowns, not veneers. For a veneer prep, I often don't even need to numb the patient (though I usually do for comfort). We stay in the enamel layer. It’s more like "scuffing" the tooth than "shaving" it down. We are removing surface imperfections and creating a roadmap for the lab technician. Most of my patients are surprised by how fast and non-invasive it feels compared to a filling.</p>

  <h2>The Temporary Phase</h2>
  <p>Another reason we prep is to give you a "test drive."</p>

  <div class="clinical-box">
    <h3>🦷 The Prototype Smile</h3>
    <p>Once I shape the teeth slightly, I make you acrylic temporaries that look exactly like the final design. If we didn't prep the teeth, the temporaries would be paper-thin and break instantly. By reducing the tooth slightly, we have room to make strong, beautiful temporaries. You wear these for two weeks. This allows us to check the length, the shape, and your speech. It’s the ultimate safety net to ensure you love the final result.</p>

  So, <strong><a href="https://dilysnt.github.io/Blog/do-you-need-to-shave-teeth-for-veneers.html" style="color: var(--primary);">do you need to shave teeth for veneers</a></strong>? In most cases, yes—but only a tiny amount. It is the difference between a smile that looks fake and bulky versus a smile that looks like you were born with it. Don't let the fear of the drill stop you from getting a natural result; conservative preparation is the secret to invisible dentistry.</p>
