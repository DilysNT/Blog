<div class="article-content">
  <p>When you get braces, you are essentially bonding small "plaque traps" to your teeth. The archwire creates a physical barrier that prevents traditional flossing, leading to a rapid accumulation of biofilm. If left unchecked, this biofilm demineralizes the enamel, causing permanent "white spot lesions" (WSLs) around the brackets.</p>
  
  <h2>Why Water Flossers Aren't Enough</h2>
  <p>Many patients ask if they can just use a Waterpik. While water flossers are excellent for flushing out large food debris (like spinach or bread), they cannot remove the sticky biofilm layer. Think of it like washing a car: you can spray it with a hose (Waterpik), but if you don't scrub it with a sponge (floss), the dirt film remains. You <strong>must</strong> use mechanical friction to clean the contact points between teeth.</p>

  <h2>The Floss Threader Technique</h2>

    <h3>🧵 Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Use a rigid floss threader (looks like a plastic needle) to pull the floss <em>behind</em> the archwire.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Gently seesaw the floss down between the teeth. Do not snap it, or you will injure the gums.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Curve the floss into a "C" shape around the side of one tooth and scrub up and down. Then repeat for the adjacent tooth.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pull the floss out and re-thread for the next gap.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Frequency and Tools</h2>
  <p>This process is tedious, taking about 10-15 minutes. Realistically, you should do this once a day, preferably at night. To speed things up, you can use "orthodontic platypus flossers"—pre-threaded floss picks with a thin arm designed to slide under the wire. These are a game-changer for teenagers or anyone with limited dexterity.</p>

    <h3>⚠️ The Consequence of Neglect</h3>
    <p>If gums bleed when you floss, it means you aren't flossing enough. That is active gingivitis. The bleeding is your body trying to flush out bacteria. Keep flossing gently but consistently, and the bleeding will stop within a week as the gums heal.</p>
